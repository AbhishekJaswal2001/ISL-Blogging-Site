<td><p>The Indian Super League (ISL) is a men&#39;s professional football league in India. For sponsorship reasons, the league is officially known as the Hero Indian Super League. One of the top football leagues in the country, it currently shares the top spot in the Indian football league system with the I-League. The league is contested by 10 teams and ran from November to March during the 2017–18 season.<br><br><br>

Founded on 21 October 2013 in partnership with IMG, Reliance Industries, and Star Sports, the Indian Super League was launched with the goal of growing the sport of football in India and increase its exposure in the country.The league&#39;s first season took place in 2014 with eight teams. During the first three seasons of the Indian Super League, the league operated without official recognition from the Asian Football Confederation, the governing body for the sport in Asia.The league also operated along the same lines of the Indian Premier League, the country&#39;s premier Twenty20 cricket competition, with the league campaign lasting for only two to three months and matches being held every day. However, before the 2017–18 season, the league earned recognition from the AFC, expanded to ten teams, and extended its schedule to five months, with matches played mainly on weekends.</p></td><td><img src="Indian_Super_League.svg_.png" height="200" width="200"><br><br><br></td></tr></table></tr>

  <tr></td><td><img src="C:\Users\Kritika\Desktop\web project\origin pic.jpg" height="200" width="300"></td><td><p>Football in India has existed in many forms since the game first arrived in the country during the 19th century with the first nationwide club competition, the Durand Cup, being founded in 1888. Despite India&#39;s early history in the game, the country&#39;s first nationwide football league did not begin until the semi-professional National Football League commenced in 1996. Prior to the creation of the National Football League, most clubs played in state leagues or select nationwide tournaments.

Ten years after the formation of the National Football League, the All India Football Federation, the governing body for the sport in India, decided to reformat the league as the I-League in an effort to professionalize the game. However, during the following seasons, the league would suffer from a lack of popularity due to poor marketing and poor quality of football.


A couple months later, on 9 December 2010, it was announced that the AIFF had signed a new 15-year, 700–crore deal with Reliance Industries and the International Management Group. The deal gave IMG–Reliance exclusive commercial rights to sponsorship, advertising, broadcasting, merchandising, video, franchising, and the right to create a new football league.
